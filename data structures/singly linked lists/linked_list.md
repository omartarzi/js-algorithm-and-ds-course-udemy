* Do not have indexes!
* Connected via nodes with a next pointer
* Random access is not allowed


* Insertion -   O(1)
* Removal -   It depends.... O(1) or O(N)
* Searching -   O(N)
* Access -   O(N)

* Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required
  * You just need to access in order and you don't care about random access
* Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not
* The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
