### Linear Search
* This function accepts an array and a value
* Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value
* If it is, return the index at which the element is found
* If the value is never found, return -1

## Binary Search (array is already ordered/sorted)
* Binary search is a much faster form of search
* Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
* Binary search only works on sorted arrays!
